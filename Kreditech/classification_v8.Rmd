```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=5, fig.height=5,
                      echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

```

Let's see and touch a bit the training data

```{r cache=TRUE}


train = read.csv(file="Training.csv", header = TRUE,  fill=TRUE, sep = ';')
valid = read.csv(file="Validation.csv", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE, sep = ';')
summary(train)
str(train)
```
Some of the features are factors (and some of them are skewed).
Other features are numeric and intereger.

Firstly, one shall load all libraries one might need during data play.
Also, parallel run would be a good idea as training a neural network (avNNet or nnet) is simply too heavy for my laptop.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(doParallel); library(parallel)
cores=detectCores()
clust = makeCluster(cores)
registerDoParallel(clust)
library(caret); library(kernlab); library(ISLR); library(RANN);
library(DMwR);library(MASS); library(randomForest); library(e1071)

train_caret = train
valid_caret = valid

```
These features look like numbers, let's make them so.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
train_caret$v17 = as.numeric(train_caret$v17)
train_caret$v19 = as.numeric(train_caret$v19)
train_caret$v29 = as.numeric(train_caret$v29)

valid_caret$v17 = as.numeric(valid_caret$v17)
valid_caret$v19 = as.numeric(valid_caret$v19)
valid_caret$v29 = as.numeric(valid_caret$v29)

```

Now one should get rid of NA's. There are two ways: either call complete.cases or do imputation.
As the dataset is not that big, I would rather prefer to keep not clean records, we may desperately need them for nnet or rf training...Therefore, calling imputation

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

train_caret= knnImputation(train_caret, k=75)
valid_caret = knnImputation(valid_caret, k=25)

```

The training data is quite skewed, "no." is marginally present.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

table(train_caret$classLabel)
table(valid_caret$classLabel)

train_caret = downSample(train_caret[,-19], train_caret$classLabel, yname = "classLabel")

```

Here just trying to spot features with near to zero variation...None is detected.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

train_nsv = nearZeroVar(train_caret, saveMetrics = TRUE)
train_nsv

#valid_nsv = nearZeroVar(valid_caret, saveMetrics = TRUE)
#valid_nsv

```

We need to have a first glance at all-to-all features correlations.
On the left the plot corresponds to the training set and on the right, to the validation one.
First outstanding things to notice are that v18 is just a multiple of v39 and therefore is redundant.
Second interesting thing is that v7 has 100% correlation with the most important thing - classLabel.
And it can be seen from the validation plot, this feature is poisonous and totally misguiding.
This v7 feature should be excluded, otherwise the power of the predictor will be similar to flipping a coin (50% chance) as f and t factors are equally populated in the validation set (in feature v7).
Just a small remark, it becomes evident below that visualising 19 features is a tough job.
However, in this report I plotted these matrices just for the purpose of first feeling.
After this, one can plot specific regions for thorough understanding.
Anyway, excluding feature by feature, the plots will be seen better.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE,out.extra='style="float:left"',cache=TRUE}
featurePlot(x=train_caret, y=train_caret$classLabel, plot="pairs")
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE,out.extra='style="float:center"',cache=TRUE}
featurePlot(x=valid_caret, y=valid_caret$classLabel, plot="pairs")
```

Now I present my random forest classifier. Currently it has 90% accuracy.
I played also with other methods, namely, svm, knn, glm, and nnet as well as its avNNet version.
All of them result in somewhat lower accuracy, which is varying between 80-90%.
Not bad after all.
A small remark: creating new features (logarithmic or polynomial) didn't help to achieve better accuracy.
Sadly.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
control <- trainControl(method="cv", number=10, repeats=5)
model_RF = train(classLabel~., data=train_caret[,-c(12,17)], method="rf", preProcess="range", trControl=control, tuneGrid = expand.grid(.mtry = c(2:6)),  n.tree=188, maxit=2000)

PREDICTION = predict(model_RF, newdata=valid_caret[,-c(12,17,19)])

confusionMatrix(PREDICTION,valid_caret[,19])

```

So, after getting roughly 90% of accuracy, one could focus on features, understand them individual and collaborative role and importance.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

control <- rfeControl(functions=rfFuncs, method="cv", number=10)
# run the RFE algorithm
results <- rfe(train_caret[,-c(12,17,19)], train_caret[,19], sizes=c(1:16), rfeControl=control)
# summarize the results
print(results)
# list the chosen features
predictors(results)
# plot the results

#plot(results, type=c("g", "o"))

importance <- varImp(model_RF, scale=FALSE)
# summarize importance
print(importance)
# plot importance
#plot(importance)
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE,out.extra='style="float:left"',cache=TRUE}
plot(results, split=c(1,1,1,2))
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE,out.extra='style="float:center"',cache=TRUE}
plot(importance, split=c(1,2,1,2))

index_FP = ((PREDICTION != valid_caret$classLabel) & (PREDICTION == 'yes.'))
index_FN = ((PREDICTION != valid_caret$classLabel) & (PREDICTION == 'no.'))

```

Above we found most important features: v2, v31, v34, v19, v12.
These are most relevant for our predictor. We should keep it in mind.
Here would be interesting to have a closer look at False Positives and False Negatives of our predictor.
For instance, it can be seen that for features v2, v34, v21, v12 some regions are very narrowed.
 With a caution and care this observation can be exploited for creating extra features, which would differentiate better points corresponding to different classLabels.

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE,out.extra='style="float:left"',cache=TRUE}
featurePlot(x=valid_caret[index_FP,-c(12,17,19)], y=valid_caret[index_FP,]$classLabel, plot="pairs")
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE,out.extra='style="float:center"',cache=TRUE}
featurePlot(x=valid_caret[index_FN,-c(12,17,19)], y=valid_caret[index_FN,]$classLabel, plot="pairs")
```
